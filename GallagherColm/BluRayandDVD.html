<p>Kim Bottomley, Renagown, Lyreacrompane Resident

  We have used Shane Kelly Communications on a couple of occasions. 

Jason has installed a multi-zone home theatre for us. 

He was very helpful with advice and what to look for in a product in a product that would suit us. I would highly recommend the service and will use them in the future. 



Ray Falconer – Abbeyfeale, Limerick Resident

I would recommend to others and would use services again. 

I have had previous work done, very happy with recommendations for products fitted. 

Thank you 

Jacquie Estreich – Ballybunnion Resident

As a property owner in Ballybunnion, I regularly require repairs and maintenance, and my TV antenna is one of those on the list. I used Jason from Shane Kelly TV Antenna Service and was delighted with not only his professionalism in doing a ‘good job’, but his prompt and efficient customer service which was second to non. 

Indeed, Jason’s pleasant ‘nothing is too much trouble’ attitude requires a special mention. Plus, Jason did not leave my home until he was sure that everything was working perfectly and that any mess made was cleaned up. Thank you Jason. 

Shane Kelly – Original Owner

I, Shane Kelly, started the business in 1992 during my final year of an Electrical Engineering Degree at QUT in IT Tralee. The business grew rapidly and very soon I needed assistance. Jason Casson joined Shane Kelly TV Antenna Service in 1993. He quickly proved to be a devoted, intelligent and hardworking employee. 

Jason and I thoroughly enjoyed working together, and enjoyed the challenges involved in a constantly evolving industry. We were always motivated by the rewards of providing great service to our customers. 

In 2009, both Jason and I were ready for a new challenge. I was offered one in the form of a Surveying/Project Management position at Morgan Earthworks. My decision to accept this new position was a win win for both Jason and myself. 

With Jason’s strong work ethic, great people skills and 20 years experience in the business, he was of course, the perfect person to takeover as proprietor. His wife, Louise, makes the perfect business partner with over 20 years experience in Administration, Payroll and Office
Management.

My wife Bernadette and I had no hesitation in handing the reins over to Jason and Louise. There is no doubt in our minds that they will operate Shane Kelly TV Antenna Service with the same professionalism, attention to detail and customer care as it has always been
operated. 
It is no surprise to us that the business is thriving under Jason’s ownership. I am honoured that he chose to maintain the name ‘Shane Kelly TV Antenna Service’. I am very proud to continue to be connected with such a successful business. Kirsty Miller, Cork City Resident

Really loved the service from this company. Friendly, efficient and helpful.

I heard Jason had an excellent reputation and they were right! 

I highly rate Shane Kelly Communications – a lovely person as well, which is always a bonus! 

Peter & Judith Keenan – Owners (Keenan Electrical – Tralee)

Keenan Electrical has been working with and recommending Shane Kelly TV Antenna Service for 20 years plus. 

Now Jason Casson has taken over the business, after being trained by Shane Kelly, we have found his work to be of the same quality and professionalism as before. 

Jason is very capable and his workmanship is of top quality, with his knowledge, respect and friendliness. Therefore we have no hesitation in recommending Jason for any future work with our customers and for ourselves. </p>

<h2>TV Services</h2>

<p>If you’re looking for a reliable TV aerial installation service in Kerry, then look no further than Shane Kelly Communications. We operate in Kerry and across Munster, and pride ourselves on offering a fast and reliable aerial installation service at a price that’s right.<br><br>

Perhaps your TV aerial is old and is having an adverse effect on the quality of your reception. It may have been damaged in a recent storm, or the cable sleeve may be worn through. There are lots of reasons why your TV aerial, or its connecting cable may be causing problems with your television reception. This is where Shane Kelly Communications can help in Kerry. We will quickly identify the problem and do a complete repair or replacement on the spot. <br><br>

Sometimes, problems can be caused by ‘too much’ signal. All often people buy the highest gain aerial they can get their hands on, when the reality is they’re too close to the transmitter for high gain to be of benefit. In fact, it can also have an adverse effect on your reception. Using our specialist monitoring equipment, we will install a TV aerial which is perfectly calibrated to the transmitted signal in your area, giving you a crisp and clear reception in Kerry.</p><br><br>

The scheme is backed by the Government and requires every member to become qualified and undergo important checks.<br><br>

Only professionally trained installers like us who are members of the RDI and CAI can meet these demands!<br><br>

Not only do we supply the products you want, but we will come to your house, install it and make sure everything is set up properly AND show you how to use it all. We take great pride in our installations, aerials & satellites systems and home cinema setups, we hate seeing wires strewn all over the place as much as you do.<br><br>
